  <h3>tl;dr intro</h3>

<p><a href="http://sf.adacamp.org/">AdaCamp is explained here at this link</a>.</p>

<p>I went to a few sessions, namely: <strong>Open Education</strong>, <strong>Open Source in Education</strong>, <strong>From Syntax to Coding</strong>, and <strong>Ada Lovelace: the Mythos</strong> + read notes from several others.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping to put things I learned together in a more structured/concise narrative, but for the moment, in an effort not to logjam things because I need them to be perfect/presentable, I put together some notes as I took them that seemed particularly relevant to things I&#8217;ve been recently doing or thinking about that also seem relevant to Open.Michigan in at least a tangential way (this isn&#8217;t to say all of this is immediately relevant by any means)</p>

<p>Some of this time in sessions, etc, was spent split up into smaller groups for discussion, so some of these notes are direct from notes that other people took as summaries.</p>

<p>Comments at AdaCamp are not attributed to people without explicit consent, by agreement, hence total lack of participant names, etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to split things up into approximate categories, but there is a a lot of crossover.</p>

<h2>Idea-focused discussion, current efforts wrt &#8216;open education&#8217;</h2>

<p>Discussion of <a href="http://www.wikiseat.org/">WikiSeat</a> &#8211;
chairs are super important for education!
&#8211;> open source framework for building chairs: opened tool, also an open source furniture design framework</p>

<ol>
<li>WikiSeat will weld together stuff for free</li>
<li>they&#8217;ll send it to teachers, who give them to students</li>
<li>teachers teach a few basics about design and where to start</li>
<li>kids/students (all ages 4th grade - seniors in college) can take it home, build it on their own</li>
</ol>


<p>This can work with mult curriculums, science classes, english classes, etc; aligned with lots of core standards</p>

<p>In general: education is not just what we may canoncially think of
What plays in most integrally; assumption that open involvement is positive</p>

<p>People to look up with respect to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Antonio Von Drammond [British Columbia]</li>
<li><a href="http://teachinghumans.com/the-wikiseat-project-american-standards/">Sean Wheeler</a> &#8211; charter school in Ohio; a first makerschool (Lakewood, OH) &#8211; probably 2014</li>
<li>teachinghumans.com ^^</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, great example of openness and remixing for education that could help
- broaden the/a conversation
- useful as an example
- more? I think probably more, but have to think about this in more detail</p>

<h3>Education, esp wrt MOOCs</h3>

<p>Udacity:
pushback from professors abt what Udacity could change, take out
changes in curriculum
(&#8220;why are you teaching this&#8221; and yet for the people supplying the info it&#8217;s taught as truth &#8211; judgements on whether it&#8217;s useful &#8211; there are other ways&#8230; [but it&#8217;s always some way])</p>

<p>&#8211;> so open resources in a fully open way allow you to do stuff your way and let people adapt it as they will.
how can we integrate that with mooc frameworks?
want to offer multiple expls, branching concepts (currently not allowed by structure set up by univrersities working with udacity &#8211; true for multiple platforms)</p>

<p>remedial courses &#8211; a more difficult problem, less engagement
[but can openness help reduce stigma of &#8220;remedial&#8221; education needs, etc? what needs to change?]</p>

<p>Also for MOOCs: performance problems for people without awesome internet, for example</p>

<p>Not everyone benefits from MOOCs. Multiple reasons, mulitple ways of addressing issues, many questions.
&amp; lots of different reasons people sign up. (Completion for example: often not the user&#8217;s goal)</p>

<p>In MOOCs: peer grading &#8211; 4.8% completion; no peer grading 7% completion (source??)
What does/could this mean?</p>

<p><strong>open education platforms</strong> &#8211; platforms for open educational resources in a structured way
- where metadata is important
- big question: how do you measure quality?
- how can you talk about remixing resources?</p>

<p>e.g. <a href="http://open.umich.edu">Open.Michigan</a></p>

<p>[NMG]
-are moocs good for society?
-how do moocs interact with privilege, accessibility?
needing to be close to people</p>

<p>collab is different from videos
also, course management software: ?</p>

<h3>Tools and Use (wrt inclusivity and other things)</h3>

<p>forums! are great, useful to users, good for discussion that&#8217;s useful &#8211; lack of undersatnding re: developers&#8217; (lack of) commitmnet to forums &#8211; often v useful
Discourse [the forum platform] is great (?)</p>

<p>Is there a difference in how open resources, especially MOOCs, affect/encourage people of different genders?</p>

<p>concern with regard to codeacademy and people creating gendered courses
- there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s &#8220;go on a hot date&#8221; for example
 &amp;when kids see that &#8211; it&#8217;s reinforced, this isn&#8217;t aimed at me, or this sort of thing is ok, or really both</p>

<h3>&#8216;Alternative&#8217; education/schooling/teaching/learning</h3>

<p>homeschooling as exposing to everything vs exposing to small fraction (religion, or whatever else)</p>

<p>no access to high speed/dialup/glorified dialup/3G modems, etc &#8211; this is a form of accessibility that isn&#8217;t addressed often
you need wifi at home &#8211; are there better ways? [e.g. raspberry pi or future, wider local libraries possibilities?? &#8211;> personal note]</p>

<p>continuing education of openness and remixability along with the material in open educational resources</p>

<ul>
<li>you can remix for inclusivity.</li>
<li>you can remix for addressing to particular populations</li>
<li>you should know about remixing and what it means that the materials are open!</li>
</ul>


<p>open materials should be (potentially?) aimed at YOU whoever you are &#8211; or made that way by an instructor or someone in a similar role. (? where does the responsibility fall, and is that different from where the responsibility <em>should</em> fall?)</p>

<p>this is an age issue too &#8211; adults shouldn&#8217;t create OER for use by kids that isn&#8217;t something relevant to kids/or other populations.</p>

<p>target audiences! this is a reason remixing and open licensing is valuable &#8211;> and more discussion of this may be useful (in various spaces/contexts &#8211; part of open culture&#8230; )</p>

<p>how can definitions of things be shared across boundaries?</p>

<h3>Access and openness outside academia</h3>

<p>(notes relayed from someone who was involved in this discussion, providing a summary)</p>

<ul>
<li>wikipedia: it requires sources, biased toward online sources, what about book sources or primary sources (esp non-western countries), eg oral account sources, how can those be cited on wikipedia</li>
<li>plus, dissenting sources issues (how to address a one right answer problem, alongside &#8211; dissenting opinion section? primary source wikipedia?</li>
<li><p>does there need to be vetting? wiki interacting with libraries, librarians should know wikipedia on their own, v important)</p></li>
<li><p>ACCESS to academic articles</p></li>
<li><p>bargaining chips with publishers, institutions needing to broaden their diea of what they judge academic &#8211; what does &#8220;needing&#8221; mean? being a top blogger on an issue, good educator, etc</p>

<ul>
<li>Juan Cole&#8217;s Informed Comment materials created by him all All Rights Reserved</li>
<li>scholarly in some cases? because of his professional background?</li>
<li>in similar cases where is this line drawn (probably more I should hear/read)</li>
<li>for education (esp in higher ed but also not!), how does this matter/could change things?</li>
<li>what about blogs written by students in class? CTools etc forums? should be transparency, regarding license, access (also public/private-ness access), and also assumptions for use (some situations n/a, but some&#8230; def. possible; everything&#8217;s a potential dataset)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>MOOC vs MOC? &#8211; MOCs call themselves MOOCs (no &#8216;open&#8217;) &#8211; valuable to make these thigns available</p>

<ul>
<li>how do we know the difference? and how do we judge value?</li>
<li>this is not REMIXABLE content</li>
<li>certification?</li>
<li>but also, remixiablity is an important point</li>
<li>most are somewhere in the middle</li>
<li>edX seems to be trying to be best practice open, Coursera not prioritizing, it always depends</li>
<li>AND is it free software they&#8217;re running on?</li>
<li>dual(+) meaning of open; see <a href="https://creativecommons.org/tag/massive-open-online-course">this</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>libraries getting access to material online; how can you find material if you&#8217;re not an academic? more publicization/awareness of possibilities is needed, and wanted</p></li>
<li>this provides better access for remixing of education (even if this is a slow process)
public libraries are trying! you&#8217;lll be surprised
-try to increase discoverablity</li>
<li><p>copyright restrictions are a problem</p></li>
<li><p>email or tweet at people (eg authors of articles, professors, librarians, whomever) &#8211; this can get access!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>difficulties with joining in (open source technology, and other [similar?] group efforts)</h2>

<p>Employers unhappy with licensing</p>

<p>Community managers important &#8211; make onboarding easier (for people, also in terms of licensing stuff)</p>

<p>idea: &#8220;women want to talk, men want to read source code&#8221; &#8211; false assumptions, but similar binaries may apply to various binary-focused population groups (academics/non-academics even, although this is <em>not</em> analogous &#8211; important to look and see whether, in efforts to build things, binaries are being implicitly enforced)</p>

<p>Coders don&#8217;t document well
and in interdisciplinary efforts (and honestly what isn&#8217;t) this is a PROBLEM
socially, and work-wise
leads to jargon, leads to problems for new developers, leads to access problems
good to emphasize the HOWs (it&#8217;s easier to find whys in many Open Source communities. is it always?)</p>

<p>Lack of documentation makes open source difficult to get into, difficult to continue &#8211; difficult with respect to other stuff, too
How did you go about doing this remix? &#8211; for non-software projects, is this an important question?</p>

<p>Training grounds, mentorship. Integral part of processes that isn&#8217;t just for &#8216;new people&#8217; &#8211; lots of (potential) value</p>

<p>Step by step discussion &#8211; to find, if you can know easily then it&#8217;s easy to get involved</p>

<p>Lower bars &#8211; start out with people &#8211; focus on questions</p>

<p>Open Source Concierge! &#8211; help projects get more people, more step-by-step instructions
Applicable to copyright-type things?</p>

<p>Things that sound cool do matter, but &#8220;cool&#8221; has a lot of meanings</p>

<p>Though documentation is a good stepping stone for open source projects, it&#8217;s hard often &#8211; hard to know when to step in, hdifficult to tell what&#8217;s correct, lots of issues there</p>

<p>Not all open source projects are friendly (but at least try to believe ones that are re: people you trust)</p>

<h2>Communities within &#8216;open&#8217; spheres and disconnect</h2>

<p>Public library perspective: prohibitively expensive to make those resources available</p>

<ul>
<li>What we broadly call knowledge activism can happen at school, university - all levels</li>
<li>Why something open is better than something proprietary</li>
<li>The culture is absolutely not there</li>
<li>Galleries and museums won&#8217;t give up access to their archives</li>
</ul>


<p>Open source and the maker community are not second nature outside tech enclaves</p>

<p>Difficult to have a conversation with a librarian in many contexts
1. not in charge
2. how do you make things work</p>

<p>In education systems teachers often actively hostile towards open information</p>

<p>If you ask your average middle school teacher is Wikipedia accurate? They will say No!</p>

<ul>
<li>Academics are only credited based on publishing in journals with the highest prestige</li>
<li>The open source journals aren&#8217;t ranked as highly</li>
<li>Your merit is valued higher if you publish in certain journals</li>
<li>Two camps within open access, about open access [ more detail on this?? ]</li>
<li>Some people think Public Library of Science is great, others think they will publish anything</li>
</ul>


<p>The community is heavily made up of silos, even sub-silos (coding, &#8220;people work&#8221;)</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible for a focus on open culture/culture of sharing to HELP SOLVE this? Probably?</li>
<li>Yet it&#8217;s hard if you trust (your coworkers, your community, your partners) &#8211; hard then to trust other systems, especially enough to move to them 100%

<ul>
<li>plus the tech system problems and how they diverge</li>
<li>in open source: how can you make a generalizable system that will help More People than a single community? can one make such a thing that people may actually want to use enough that they will? are there enough resources for learning new systems without huge time investment?</li>
<li>and what is the priority of these umbrella questions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Teaching and reaching out to younger populations (esp for science)</h2>

<p>Important to pull in licensing and remixing, not just proper attribution (but also that), early in education
- can this be a puzzle? is it important to make it fun? (ideally)</p>

<p>Scientists would like to reach out to middle and high school students, but their fields are really esoteric
 &#8211;> Even middle school students can get it if it&#8217;s presented correctly</p>

<p>Howard Hughes Medical Institute - http://www.hhmi.org/, http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/activities/index.html</p>

<ul>
<li>translating actual science into projects that can be done in the classroom in one or two periods at various levels</li>
<li>Lesson plans, worksheets, materials</li>
</ul>


<p>Graduate students seem ill-prepared in some cases, university students ill-prepared</p>

<ul>
<li>especially ill prepared to share knowledge with others</li>
<li>there is a huge gap between what&#8217;s happening at middle school, high school level and what&#8217;s expected at the graduate level</li>
<li>California switching to common core, reading more nonfiction</li>
<li>A teacher of high school English pulls scholarly articles off JSTOR and uses them to give students different lenses through which to view the text</li>
</ul>


<p>A question for everyone - anxiety about working with younger people</p>

<ul>
<li>(&#8220;I treated them like my masters students&#8221;) &#8211; it worked!</li>
<li>What if scientists just had to translate for teachers? (Resounding yes)</li>
<li>Can we do translation generally? How do we make that workflow better?</li>
</ul>


<p>A conference in evolution has a track for educators</p>

<ul>
<li>There are people who focus on high school geography - AP Human Geo</li>
<li>High schools in Massachusetts doing GIS (!) &#8211; this is how you use SOFTWARE for this; help question asking, encourage. how does this work? not just for the people who define themselves as the people who want to know that</li>
<li>such a great way to do it - playing games</li>
<li>&#8220;This is so fun!&#8221; &#8211; yes that matters</li>
</ul>


<h2>Discrimination and assumption in education + OER</h2>

<p>Class and privilege disparities</p>

<ul>
<li>MOOCs - there&#8217;s an issue because not everyone has high-speed Internet</li>
<li>people keep talking about Khan Academy and things like that</li>
<li>how to curate not just in general but for different populations, understanding of how things can be used</li>
<li>in India if you don&#8217;t have video there&#8217;s no use &#8211; How can there be use?</li>
</ul>


<p>Teaching is a gendered profession</p>

<ul>
<li>is this true at all levels and in all disciplines?</li>
<li>does it matter if we&#8217;re talking about teaching because of e.g. professor role, doctor role, or focus on teaching quality and nothing else &#8211; does that change then?</li>
</ul>


<p>Condescending explanations of education</p>

<ul>
<li>how can we get teachers to teach young white male programmers how teaching works?</li>
<li>Get teachers on advisory boards? Is this specific enough?</li>
<li>Product testing!</li>
<li>Collaborative making</li>
</ul>


<p>expl from wikiseat person:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where does someone go to find teachers who are willing to think outside the box? (in one of many ways)</li>
<li>every school has at least one teacher;</li>
<li>Will Richardson, influential ed tech guy - a lot of teachers consider his word gospel;</li>
<li>103 people came to Wikiseat after he blogged about them</li>
</ul>


<h2>Curation of resources and reasons for schooling</h2>

<p>Build collections of Web sites - a curation tool</p>

<p>Read resources, answer questions</p>

<p>A beautiful Web site with no sense of direction</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;We need teachers to help us make it better&#8221;</li>
<li>Sent people into our classrooms, helped us build collections, observed class</li>
<li>building course papers for teachers</li>
<li>show me what I&#8217;ll see after you have automatically graded the multiple choice questions</li>
<li>&#8220;Teachers are helpful by nature!&#8221; &#8211; great, but how are we defining &#8220;helpful&#8221;? in what domain? how so? why?</li>
</ul>


<p>Getting a degree in computer science doesn&#8217;t translate to a career with a corporation
Lots of dropouts have done well
reimagining what an education can get them</p>

<p>Increasingly bigger distinction between academia and non-academic pursuit of knowledge (!! &#8211; personally noticed this spending time at other schools <em>with PhD students</em>, also &#8211; BUT, use of programming as a tool is valuable, these may be vaulable incentives)</p>

<p>&#8211; if NGOs used motivation in similar way to some interested people in academic depts wrt programming&#8230;</p>

<p>Academics post PDFs online - prepublication version that isn&#8217;t under copyright</p>

<ul>
<li>Seems like a better use of time and energy</li>
<li>Little things you can do</li>
<li>A ton of really great science blogs</li>
<li>(Conversation with developer at PLoS &#8211; work to abolish peer review, whoa)</li>
</ul>


<p>for examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tracy Heath http://treethinkers.org/blog/</li>
<li>Monica Stephens http://www.floatingsheep.org/</li>
<li>Holly Bik http://www.hollybik.com/</li>
<li>Jonathan and Michael Eisen http://phylogenomics.wordpress.com/
http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/</li>
<li>Carl Zimmer http://carlzimmer.com/</li>
<li>Joan Straussman http://sociobiology.wordpress.com/</li>
<li>Chronicle http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5</li>
<li>Inside Higher Ed http://www.insidehighered.com/</li>
<li>many others</li>
<li>&#8211;curated list?? by whom? so many within groups, different platforms&#8230; how even to curate links?</li>
</ul>


<h2>teaching as a skill (a bit more) &#8211; with respect to tech and programming</h2>

<p>(also see bit about academia as potential model for ngo learning)</p>

<p>value of being in a learning office</p>

<p>how best to continue shaping that culture in the most productive way?
- in schools? in grade schools? in universities?</p>

<p>Vans to villages - training kids to use the Internet, but all Windows systems</p>

<ul>
<li>millions of students in India understood Internet as synonymous with IE and computers as synonymous with Windows</li>
<li>this is true for many</li>
<li>huge age disparity in how interfaces are understood!</li>
<li>Technologists who come to teach now are precious</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to teach them if they don&#8217;t know Ubuntu&#8221;

<ul>
<li>When you teach a software demo and everyone&#8217;s on different OSs, that&#8217;s really hard!</li>
<li>it&#8217;s harder to teach introduction than almost anything else from a certain perspective</li>
<li>is it the most valuable? (I feel like I got the most from that despite the greater frustration. Is this always the case? It is noticably easier to teach people with more familiarity, or even who take to it more easily, but they aren&#8217;t the people in the most need of better curated teaching/learning, esp teaching+learning, materials &#8211; are they?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
