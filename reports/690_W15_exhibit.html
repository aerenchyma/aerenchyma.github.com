<h1>YBMen Research Application | SI 690</h1>

<p>Jackie Cohen (Winter 2015)</p>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Software Developer</p>

<p><strong>Category:</strong> Software Development / Data Analysis / Data Management</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>I spent the semester as a part-time Research Application developer in a lab at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, led by Dr. Daphne Watkins. Her lab was preparing for a social intervention series based on her research about masculinity and mental health, whose central 'locale' was a Facebook group. They had IRB approval for a research plan (which I helped with last semester), and wanted an application to be able to hold data for individual studies, each of which has an associated private Facebook group (private to participants and the lab managers), and be able to regularly collect, sort, and allow download of the individual data sets. This involved dealing with the Facebook API endpoints, privacy and security concerns, and wireframing app interactions so that I could be sure all necessary directions were included and anyone could understand how to use the application in the future.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>A few products resulted from my work this summer, along with a lot of development and learning for me. Notably, </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="">the app itself will be linked here when my work is launched with some other people in the lab (scheduled for next week)</li>
<li><a href="http://form.jotform.us/form/50004411149137">here is an example of our lab-check-in page software</a></li>
<li>paper wireframes for different site interactions</li>
<li>a lot of documentation and future plans, some of which is soon to be shared publicly</li>
<li>a PDF of documentation and a github repository (also to be released when work is launched)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy Statement</h2>

<p>I describe myself foremost as a curious person. This encapsulates a lot of things, and requires context &ndash; but everything requires, or relies upon, context.</p>

<p>There are many ways to act on <em>being curious</em>, and the ways I choose primarily is analyzing quantitative data, paired with qualitative data, gleaning information from it, and using knowledge of software development to help build useful tools. I study Information Analysis and Retrieval, especially with regard to the domains of education, intellectual property/openness, health care, and public transit, because I am interested in the way people work within systems that we (humans) have built. When I can answer a question clearly, and tell a story to someone who was formerly confused, I have succeeded.</p>

<p>What are the specific problems in a certain context? What questions should we ask? Can I help in a specific way, or can I help determine what specific problems need solving? With the tools at hand, which include the communities I belong to, these are the questions I hope to answer.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>A better understanding of planning was perhaps the most salient outcome of my experience this summer, perhaps both for me and those around me, on more than one level. Very specifically, I now clearly understand more ways of approaching a software development problem (where to go from a starting point of &#39;some product that does this sort of thing is the goal&#39;), and I have a good understanding of what methods of discussion, planning, and drawing out ideas work well for me. In the case of this particular project, some of the most important skills I've found useful are clear explanations, focused on understanding users and other self-described "non-technical" people with domain knowledge on the lab team. Being thoughtful about what details need to be conveyed in designs and what don't is useful both to others expecting results and to myself as a developer.</p>

<p>I am glad I was able to provide some of that and look forward to seeing the continued future of the work we did, product and research both. My goal was to make something the lab can pick up and use and understand, and, should another developer need to be hired, they too should be able to pick up where my work left off. I believe in this way I have been successful.</p>

<h2>Additional attachments</h2>

All of the work is really included in the app, which must go through a QA process and clearance by the lab. I can't share the authenticated side of the login, though, because it includes protected data, but hopefully suffice to say my lab manager and supervisor found it useful!
