#I. BACKGROUND

Yahoo! Answers is a subsection of the Yahoo! web platform, functioning as a crowdsourced question-and-answer service (hereafter, QAS).

Read access to Yahoo! Answers is public; semantic contributions to Yahoo! Answers (hereafter, 'Answers') by users require one of the following:
- a Yahoo! account (LINK)
- a Google account (LINK)
- a Facebook account (LINK)

Contributions to Answers can take one of four forms:
- Asking a question (more detail on this follows)
- Providing an answer to a question that has been asked
- Starring an answer as a "good answer"
- Voting on a "best answer" to a question

Question-and-answer threads on Answers are separated into [NUMBER] topic categories, which range from Health to Social Science to Dining Out. At the aggregate level (e.g. on the Answers home page, http://answers.yahoo.com, before narrowing to a particular topic category), question-answer threads (threads of answers corresponding to a single question) can be sorted by recency of posting or by popularity; popularity is determined by a (yet unspecific) algorithm which depends on the number of views of a question (one "view" is 1+ page load within a certain number of seconds or minutes by any single user) and the number of answers the question has recieved.

This paper examines a few different aspects of the Yahoo! Answers social system and how and why people use (or do not use) it, supported by primary and secondary research, user interviews, and personal experience. Following, I discuss what specifically I am examining.


#II. INVESTIGATION

In order to focus this study, I have chosen to look closely at three topic categories within Answers: Health, Science & Mathematics, and Social Science. These three are in some ways related (all may be related to academic disciplines as well as popular culture, all are things I personally feel I have some degree of knowledge about, allowing me to make some qualitative judgments about content), and examining only three of the [NUMBER] allows me to take a more specific look at differences between a few categories in order to pose further research questions.

I have never been what I would describe as a user of Answers. However, I have been peripherally aware of it for years, and without having been a user, noted that I held clear opinions and attitudes about the platform. I was curious, within the context of studying information in social systems, whether the use of this social system reflects the meta-information and metadata about it, as well as whether how people think about Yahoo! Answers, and how people think others or they themselves use it, reflects how people really seem to use it.

With this in mind, I examined two different aspects of Answers and how it is used, with an aim to discover whether a subsection of the academic commmunity's views on Answers conflate with, or conflict with, the ways in which humans interact on and use the Answers system. There are many possible perspectives from which to examine Answers. The two I dive into in this paper are as follows:

###A. Community building in a QAS, and how community norms inform actions and boundaries within the Answers system

###B. Social network analysis, and how social capital and prestige change the routes and methods of knowledge-sharing on the Answers platform

The Methods section, below, illustrates the ways in which I approached this analysis, the data I used, and how I integrated my experience using this system for the first time into the resulting analysis.


#III. METHODS [subsection]

Some parts of this research process consisted exclusively of secondary research, in academic journals and the like: though I would like to propose interesting network algorithms for analyzing social structures in Yahoo! Answers, for the moment and the purposes of this analysis, that is best left to the experts, and I've examined several pieces of work on the subject and related subjects which are discussed at length later on.

In order to gather data on people's views of Yahoo! Answers, in order to compare the way it is seen with the way it is used (that's a description of this project at a very high level), I conducted seven semi-structured formal interviews using the interview protocol you can find in Appendix A. 

I chose to interview only people who spent at least half their working time in academia: as a student, as a teacher/lecturer/professor, or (inclusively) as a researcher. I made this decision for a few reasons. [CITE SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE]

	_(if use)_
	
	- How would you describe your time asking questions and receiving answers in the system?

	- What is your process for deciding whether to respond to a question? (How frequently would you say you respond to questions?)

	- How much content do you consume (read, etc) vs generate when using Yahoo! Answers?

	- What view do you spend the most time on when using Yahoo! Answers?
		
		- Do you spend most of your time looking at/asking in/responding to a certain category w/i Yahoo! Answers?
		(follow up questions as necessary to generate conversation) 

	- Who overall would you say uses Yahoo! Answers?

	_(if not)_

	- Why not?

	- Who do you think uses Yahoo! Answers overall?

- How would you describe Yahoo! Answers? (Tailor this to whether or not they use this service)

- Why do you feel that way? (Or other questions tailored to the response/to draw out more detail)

- Ensuing discussion to tie up loose ends, as necessary. 

Expected length: 20-30 minutes.
