<h1>Open.Michigan Initiative | SI 681</h1>

<p>Jackie Cohen (Summer 2014)</p>

<p><strong>Tags:</strong> software, information architecture, plannning, </p>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Analyst/Software Developer</p>

<p><strong>Category:</strong> Education / Open Licensing / Software Development / Data Analysis</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>I spent the summer as a Software Developer/Data Analyst at the <a href="http://open.umich.edu">Open.Michigan Initiative</a>, within the Learning Program in the University of Michigan Medical School Information Services (MSIS) department. Having spent almost two years working with this office and initiative in various capacity, my goals this summer were a few &ndash; notably, to make progress on the initiative&#39;s <a href="http://open.umich.edu/connect/projects#analytics">Dynamic Analytics and Metrics Project</a> and complete a planning and organizational structure such that the project could become more easily transferrable to indidividuals and easily understandable by those outside the immediate organizational structure at Open.Michigan.</p>

<p>Working toward these goals in combination involved a series of meetings, planning sessions, research plans, design sketching, software development and programming, and a lot of software troubleshooting. Ultimately, there was probably more problem-solving involved in my experience this summer than product creation, but especially given my time depth of experience with the Open.Michigan Initiative, I believe that this time was valuably spent.</p>

<p>Myself, my mentor, and others contributing to the project spent a notable amount of time discussing options for moving the project forward, sometimes meeting with others within MSIS who had valuable perspective for our project &ndash; for example, a software architect, and a publicist for a Medical School department. I built upon ideas and plans we drew out in those meetings and created the results discussed below.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>A few products resulted from my work this summer, along with a lot of development and learning for me, and hopefully benefit to the office and those who are moving on from it as a result of discussions I was a part of, as my summer experience ends. Notably, </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openmichigan/metrics_tools">a set of schemas and scripts</a> developed with my mentor to track metrics on Open.Michigan content</li>
<li><a href="http://open.umich.edu/connect/projects#analytics">a plan for a continuation of the Dynamic Metrics and Analytics project</a>, or &ldquo;DynaMetrics&rdquo; project, and development of a <a href="https://github.com/openmichigan/oerbit_analytics">module</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openmichigan/translation_metrics">a toolset</a> to programmatically gather metrics and data on the initiative&#39;s <a href="http://open.umich.edu/connect/projects/translation">translation project</a></li>
<li>a dashboard of metrics from individual courses (for <a href="https://open.umich.edu/education/si/si508/fall2008/">example</a>) on the Open.Michigan Initiative&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/openmichigan/OERbit">OERbit platform</a></li>
<li>some syntax for doing data analysis on metrics gathered</li>
<li>a lot of documentation and future plans, some of which is soon to be shared publicly</li>
<li>e.g. <img height=50 width=50 src="681notes.jpg"></li>
<li>possibilities for further research</li>
<li>upcoming blog post (TBA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy Statement</h2>

<p>I describe myself foremost as a curious person. This encapsulates a lot of things, and requires context &ndash; but everything requires, or relies upon, context.</p>

<p>There are many ways to act on <em>being curious</em>, and the ways I choose primarily is analyzing quantitative data, paired with qualitative data, gleaning information from it, and using knowledge of software development to help build useful tools. I study Information Analysis and Retrieval, especially with regard to the domains of education, intellectual property/openness, health care, and public transit, because I am interested in the way people work within systems that we (humans) have built. When I can answer a question clearly, and tell a story to someone who was formerly confused, I have succeeded.</p>

<p>What are the specific problems in a certain context? What questions should we ask? Can I help in a specific way, or can I help determine what specific problems need solving? With the tools at hand, which include the communities I belong to, these are the questions I hope to answer.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>A better understanding of planning was perhaps the most salient outcome of my experience this summer, perhaps both for me and those around me, on more than one level. Very specifically, I now clearly understand more ways of approaching a software development problem (where to go from a starting point of &#39;some product that does this sort of thing is the goal&#39;), and I have a good understanding of what methods of discussion, planning, and drawing out ideas work well for me. In the case of the <a href="http://open.umich.edu/connect/projects#analytics">project</a> I spent much of my time on, both I and others on the team gained a better understanding of the avenues possible to achieve our goals, and even altered our goals and plans somewhat, due to our collective exploration. These are some of the ultimate takeaways from the work I&#39;ve done here.</p>

<p>On a lower level, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to think a lot, and contribute thoughts to this office, about dancing between aiming for generalization and code reuseability, an important factor in open source and open licensing work, and simply making a system work for a given situation, doing user testing and interviewing, and pushing through from there. Our use cases called for a mix of prototyping fidelity and workable scripts, and I am glad I was able to provide some of that and look forward to seeing the continued future of the work we did, product and research both.</p>
