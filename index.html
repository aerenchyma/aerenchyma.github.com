  <div class="entry-content"><h2>once upon a time</h2>

<p>in late 2012, I was at a bar with some friends, but the night ended with some excitement.</p>

<p>Soon after I left, I began writing a script in order to put together .csv files of locations, names, and phone numbers of various types of sites within a certain radius! The exclamation point there is a little facetious, but I&#8217;m not kidding about the excitement. I love information retrieval and teaching programming for use to improve efficiency. I like scripting and any chance to share how cool it is; this was all of the above.</p>

<p>This is a project that&#8217;s taken place in several parts, and due to various pending Terms-of-Service (TOS) agreements and new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api">API</a> developments, I won&#8217;t be publishing the final version of the code online <em>yet.</em> But I&#8217;m outlining this process here anyhow because I think writing about code is good.</p>

<p><a href="http://aerenchyma.github.io/blog/2013/04/15/a-useful-ruby-script-for-mapping-projects/">Part I</a> (this post) will address the basic technical architecture of writing a Ruby script to speed up data-gathering for a local non-profit organization, use of particular Ruby gems, etc (and the initial questions that led to the script writing).</p>

<p><a href="">Part II</a> (to come) will address the whys &#8211; specifically, why Ruby worked well for this project and what I found to be useful takeaways from it. I am especially interested in takeaways with respect to teaching programming, ways of looking at projects as a developer, and application of technical skills as a service.</p>

<p><a href="">Part III</a> (to come) will address further technical possibilities &#8211; what should work better, what tools are future possibilities, what questions this generated, and a clear outline of what I&#8217;ve learnt (from a programming perspective) by working on this.</p>

<li><p>Sometimes, the best system is Windows XP and Word 2000 and the mail app you hate.</p></li>
<li><p>The hardest part of unpaid tech support is learning when not to argue about (1).</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Being unpaid tech support&#8221; == being the youngest person in a group by 20+ years, having the most technical experience in a group re: profession or degree, or whichever turns out to be most applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;whichever turns out to be the most applicable&#8221; in (3) is chiefly determined by your confidence in tone, if there is any question as to who&#8217;s landed the job.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Why&#8221; is the easiest question to ask and the hardest one to answer.*</p></li>
<li><p>I do not like the Mac OS X mail app.</p></li>
<li><p>Even beginning to describe the differences between what you work on and what their problem is tends to be worth it approximately 15% of the time. **</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that email (and all of the cloud) is (<em>theoretically</em>) unconstrained by political boundaries is a real conceptual jump from &#8220;snail mail.&#8221; Especially if one&#8217;s professional life has been largely spent, for example, writing books on yellow notepads.</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;I can solve this problem I&#8217;ve never seen before&#8221;, outside of work or a personal project, is often worth the frustration.***</p></li>
<li><p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with <a href="http://xkcd.com/627/">the quintessential flow chart</a> (credit Randall Monroe under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">BY-NC</a> license), but there are people for whom the system this chart depends on makes sense, and there are people to whom it&#8217;s another universe. The boundary is fluid &#8211; I firmly believe this &#8211; but if you&#8217;re the resident expert (or whatever), it sure doesn&#8217;t feel that way.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick drive-by: <a href="https://github.com/aerenchyma/instabitly">instabitly</a>, a script I wrote recently to import saved links from <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> to <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>.</p>

<p>I did it for personal reasons &#8211; primarily because I want all this stuff stored redundantly. Obviously I haven&#8217;t solved that problem in its entirety, but there were also other reasons. Because I care about things like this. There&#8217;s a README. More, like more in the other documentation series I&#8217;ve discussed so far, will have to appear after recent projects calm down some.</p>

<p>Let me also take this opportunity to encourage you to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/subscription">support Instapaper</a> if you can and it&#8217;s a service you like/use.</p>

<p>In my imaginary free time, I have been trying to absorb all the <a href="http://pyvideo.org/category/33/pycon-us-2013">fantastic PyCon</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides">talks</a> (I have an active imagination).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting in January 2013, I have been a software developer at the <a href="http://open.umich.edu">Open.Michigan Initiative</a>, which is housed within the University of Michigan Medical School. Open.Michigan (OM) promotes open licensing and open educational resources (OER), and we publish OER on our website, which is run on the <a href="https://github.com/openmichigan/OERbit">OERbit</a> framework, which in turn is based on <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.</p>

<p><small>(True to our goals, all the code we produce is open source, free for use and adaptation with attribution. See licenses.)</small></p>

<p>My first project is Open.Michigan Analytics &#8211; accessing, displaying, and allowing access to analytics for the resources we publish. In twelve words or fewer. Hah. I am documenting the process, including decisions and missteps as well as step-by-steps of enacted processes, especially because this includes my progress learning Drupal (I am flexible with languages, but I have most experience developing in Python, and I had never worked even semi-professionally in PHP before this project), and adaptations and contributions to a fairly new open source project, examples of which are good to have. Also, if anyone picks this up inside or outside our office, I&#8217;d like to have documentation of the development (and not just its use) around.</p>

<p>Below, I set out the original planning stages and goals for the project. Soon: the first decisions made, setup issues, and options I set out for proceeding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On May first, I reached the end of Michigan&#8217;s 2012 Winter semester, and with it the end of one of the best jobs. A student called the deadline for the final projects the &#8220;end of an era&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s what it felt like to us (the staff), too. (&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re doing twenty projects!&#8221;)</p>

<p>Except that it&#8217;s more thrilling to watch people work together and seriously, rapidly and usefully learn stuff, and help each other &#8211; better to watch forty-some eureka moments than only have a few yourself.</p>
