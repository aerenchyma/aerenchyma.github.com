  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last May, when I was first thinking about applying to <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>, I did a lot of searching for posts and tweets about it. I wanted to know what the experience was like, the day-to-day, the people. I found some, and <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/about" target="_blank">the website does give a very accurate picture</a> of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/testimonials" target="_blank">the environment</a> around all the time at Hacker School, but I wished for more because I&#8217;m curious, especially about the environment alongside the programming. Hacker School is all about being a better programmer &#8211; going after that goal has come with a lot of side pluses.</p>

<p>(There&#8217;s now <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7kld/iama_hacker_at_hacker_school_in_nyc_ama/">an IAmA for Hacker School going on @ Reddit</a>, where a bunch of current Hackerschoolers and alums are articulately answering questions. So you should go there.)</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;d say that if you have a real inclination to apply &#8211; if you think you might love programming &#8211; if the sound of Hacker School interests you &#8211; do it. Do it soon, do it now! <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com/apply">Just click here</a>! I understand that moving to NYC on somewhat quick notice is intimidating, that you&#8217;re not sure what will happen with work or other potential commitments, that maybe the cost is concerning, but I swear the facilitators and even your fellow batch-mates (especially if there are people coming back who are familiar with the process!) are incredibly helpful with that stuff, in particular with finding housing. It&#8217;s workable, not so bad, even without much stress!, and having the option is worth the application time.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a woman who needs financial assistance, I can&#8217;t emphasize enough, <i>don&#8217;t</i> hesitate because you&#8217;re afraid it won&#8217;t work out! This batch, every accepted woman who requested a grant received one, and there&#8217;s no reason to believe that won&#8217;t happen again.</p>

<p>Secondly, here&#8217;s another addition to the growing library of &#8216;what it&#8217;s like at Hacker School&#8217;. As we approach the end of batch[3] &#8211; (numbers started at 0, of course), I&#8217;m just gonna list you some things I did this summer, in no particular order.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Spent a wholly worthwhile thirteen total out of about forty hours in Central Park one Thursday - Friday. Most of those were waiting in line for tickets to As You Like It in the Park. Many of those hours were talking and laughing with a Hacker School friend. Some were making an attempt at a picnic at sunrise. Some of them were us programming in Python in a text editor and REPL with an Android phone. (Three of the hours were at night, watching the show, which was one of the best Shakespeare performances I&#8217;ve ever seen.)</p></li>
<li><p>Played in a Hacker School Ping Pong tournament. (No requirement to be especially good. Hence &lt;&#8211; .) The first Ping Pong tournament, a laptop was pulled out midway through&#8230; now, there is a relative-player-ranking system that a fellow Hackerschooler implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost made it to building and launching homemade water rockets.</p></li>
<li><p>Went on an 11-person, 120-total-dumpling tour in Chinatown. Wandered for hours below 14th street talking about fascinating things incl. translations of brand names and living in different areas of the country. (&#8230;not on the same day.)</p></li>
<li><p>Got delicious Malaysian food, tasted the best guacamole of my life, ventured to Long Island for a cupcake baked by an awesome fellow Hackerschooler (worth the trip!). I&#039;ve eaten crazy delicious stuff while in New York [and most of it wasn&#8217;t too expensive + in good company].</p></li>
<li><p>Had many dinners and lunches and otherwise hanging out with alums, current batch members, Hacker School facilitators wherein there were discussions of topics ranging from the structure of Git, to islands in the Pacific where time is measured differently, to what is nerve-wracking about interviews, to the best kind of chocolate (no consensus), to what we were like as teenagers in various capacity, to awesome books recently read, to the differences between ricotta, queso fresco and paneer.</p></li>
<li><p>Collapsed laughing over the packaging of bear-shaped cookies sold at a nearby cafe during a quick programming break. Began to learn Cued Speech. Ran outside to dance around in a sudden rainstorm by the Brooklyn Bridge.</p></li>
<li><p>Got basically addicted to iced coffee: people at a nearby cafe* have started recognizing some of our orders; we joke about it, slash about how many times we&#8217;ve been there. <s>Each day.</s> I&#8217;ve been there a&#8230;lot. (Coffee ice cubes in the iced coffee/espresso drinks. Need I say more.)</p></li>
<li><p>Learned tons about parsing, web scraping, Ruby, dealing with dynamic web content, tree- and graph-traversal algorithms, multiple web frameworks, client-side Javascript debugging, how to structure my time, how to read a large code base better, short presentations, window managers, various contributions to open source projects, awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>s, how to use Git well (and <a href="http://marthakelly.github.com/blog/2012/06/04/hacker-school-day-one/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t worry at all</a> if you don&#8217;t know about any one or any of those things). Also, about baking, varieties of international visas, mapping, moving, chemicals, New York, regions of the US, circuits, public speaking, work environments, acidic agents in cheese-making and tons of other things; that&#8217;s not a comprehensive list. I&#8217;m going back to school (for grad school in CS) in the fall (this was already a plan when I applied to Hacker School), but I now feel solidly on a trajectory to doing whatever the hell I want, and learning whatever that requires, in a way I did not at the beginning of June. (I&#8217;ve also gained an even more thorough respect for transportation networks, something I already loved a lot.) Seeing pairs of people attempt things totally new to them and be ridiculous successful while you and others do the same at the next table is the best.</p></li>
<li><p>Met some of the most impressive and inspiring thinkers, programmers, cooks, writers, feminists, and <i>people</i> I&#8217;ve ever met at once. I&#8217;ve made really good friends with whom I&#8217;ve done lots of entirely random and excellent things, who have changed how I think about things spanning-realms-within and far-beyond programming, and I&#8217;m not planning to disappear &#8211; I&#8217;ll be back to visit.</p></li>
<li><p>More than a year later, I come back to this post, and while I have plenty to add, the most important cultural thing I can say about Hacker School now is that not only do I continue to realize things I gained in the summer of 2012, programming and other-wise, but on numerous trips around the country (the US, in my case), it&#8217;s often Hacker Schoolers in all these cities that make them feel a little bit like home.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You should probably apply. If you read this you should apply. (If you didn&#8217;t, and you enjoy programming, you should also apply, but that&#8217;s probably not relevant at this juncture.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On May first, I reached the end of Michigan&#8217;s 2012 Winter semester, and with it the end of one of the best jobs. A student called the deadline for the final projects the &#8220;end of an era&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s what it felt like to us (the staff), too. (&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re doing twenty projects!&#8221;)</p>

<p>Except that it&#8217;s more thrilling to watch people work together and seriously, rapidly and usefully learn stuff, and help each other &#8211; better to watch forty-some eureka moments than only have a few yourself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A brief interlude, relating to teaching programming. My co-IA and I subbed for lecture today; the professor we work for is at a conference in another state.</p>

<p>The class has a facebook group for posting tips and asking each other questions. Halfway through class (I found this out afterward), this appears on the group, and by half an hour after the class is over, it looks like this:</p>

<p>What a great job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.igniteannarbor.com/" target="_blank">Five minutes. Twenty slides. What would you say?</a></p>

<p>I spoke at Ignite Ann Arbor on Sunday &#8211; &#8220;Data Entry, Coffee Dripping, and Other Things as Interesting as Watching Paint Dry.&#8221; You can see the video and my slides linked on my <a href="http://aerenchyma.github.io/about/">about</a> page.</p>

<p>A year ago, I was talking about that with a friend in the common room of my co-op. I wrote about that in my first grad school applications. Months later, the same friend suggested I do an Ignite talk about paint drying. He was only half joking, if that.</p>

<p>I considered the idea and I waited and on October tenth (the deadline for the call for speakers) I figured if I never pressed the button, well, I never would.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>I was accepted, and really nervous, and it turned out awesome, Ignite 6. It was awesome for me because I did fine and enjoyed it as I did it. It was pretty much the opposite of painful, though that&#8217;s in no small part due to practice and Emily (<a href="https://twitter.com/epuckett">@epuckett</a>)&#8217;s advice &#8211; and because of all the people who showed up to see it, and also the people who came to see me. I&#8217;m grateful to have so many fantastic friends, people who wanted to be there, supportive people I work with; their help was incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s harder to prepare for those five minutes than to actually do it. It&#8217;s easy to forget how many people applied for a similar reason to me and have similar amounts of public speaking experience (not tons, at the time, though it wasn&#8217;t the public speaking aspect that worried me &#8211; it was whether I would disappoint myself in my representation, because the process of paint drying, like the chemicals in coffee and data entry jobs, is seriously cool).</p>

<p>Awesome, because I know now what goes into preparing for that and it&#8217;s more impressive up close, though it was impressive from further away too. Awesome, because there was stuff about food and cold (and a lot about energy) and schooling and learning and applying lessons from non-school, and there were interested people in the audience, which is a good part. &#8220;Science is cool, y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let it be noted, for the sake of honesty, that I spent the two weeks prior to speaking almost wishing I hadn&#8217;t applied, fighting procrastination of completing my slides because of the nervousness, and then slightly freaking out about arranging what I would say (yes, in that order). &#8220;Tell me not to do it,&#8221; I said, of deciding to do a presentation ever again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me do this ever again. Stop me.&#8221; A friend said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t. But yeah, okay.&#8221; I made a face, in part because I guessed he might be right.</p>

<p>Well, okay: He was right, as was the friend who told me to do it in the first place, and I&#8217;ve learnt my lesson.</p>

<p>I am more than pleased to have done this. Also &#8211; &#8220;How&#8217;d you get to be such a geek?&#8221; &#8211; best compliment I&#8217;ve ever received from someone I didn&#8217;t already know.</p>
