<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.igniteannarbor.com/" target="_blank">Five minutes. Twenty slides. What would you say?</a></p>

<p>I spoke at Ignite Ann Arbor on Sunday &#8211; &#8220;Data Entry, Coffee Dripping, and Other Things as Interesting as Watching Paint Dry.&#8221; You can see the video and my slides linked on my <a href="http://aerenchyma.github.io/about/">about</a> page.</p>

<p>A year ago, I was talking about that with a friend in the common room of my co-op. I wrote about that in my first grad school applications. Months later, the same friend suggested I do an Ignite talk about paint drying. He was only half joking, if that.</p>

<p>I considered the idea and I waited and on October tenth (the deadline for the call for speakers) I figured if I never pressed the button, well, I never would.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>I was accepted, and really nervous, and it turned out awesome, Ignite 6. It was awesome for me because I did fine and enjoyed it as I did it. It was pretty much the opposite of painful, though that&#8217;s in no small part due to practice and Emily (<a href="https://twitter.com/epuckett">@epuckett</a>)&#8217;s advice &#8211; and because of all the people who showed up to see it, and also the people who came to see me. I&#8217;m grateful to have so many fantastic friends, people who wanted to be there, supportive people I work with; their help was incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s harder to prepare for those five minutes than to actually do it. It&#8217;s easy to forget how many people applied for a similar reason to me and have similar amounts of public speaking experience (not tons, at the time, though it wasn&#8217;t the public speaking aspect that worried me &#8211; it was whether I would disappoint myself in my representation, because the process of paint drying, like the chemicals in coffee and data entry jobs, is seriously cool).</p>

<p>Awesome, because I know now what goes into preparing for that and it&#8217;s more impressive up close, though it was impressive from further away too. Awesome, because there was stuff about food and cold (and a lot about energy) and schooling and learning and applying lessons from non-school, and there were interested people in the audience, which is a good part. &#8220;Science is cool, y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let it be noted, for the sake of honesty, that I spent the two weeks prior to speaking almost wishing I hadn&#8217;t applied, fighting procrastination of completing my slides because of the nervousness, and then slightly freaking out about arranging what I would say (yes, in that order). &#8220;Tell me not to do it,&#8221; I said, of deciding to do a presentation ever again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me do this ever again. Stop me.&#8221; A friend said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t. But yeah, okay.&#8221; I made a face, in part because I guessed he might be right.</p>

<p>Well, okay: He was right, as was the friend who told me to do it in the first place, and I&#8217;ve learnt my lesson.</p>

<p>I am more than pleased to have done this. Also &#8211; &#8220;How&#8217;d you get to be such a geek?&#8221; &#8211; best compliment I&#8217;ve ever received from someone I didn&#8217;t already know.</p>
