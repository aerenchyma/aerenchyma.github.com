    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I went back to my old high school to help a friend teach middle schoolers an introductory workshop on Python and Raspberry Pi. It was thoroughly awesome, but amidst the awesome -- which I'm not going to talk about in detail yet -- I noticed something interesting:</p>

<p>Discussing comments in Python, someone in the room who graduated college several years before I did called '#', without hesitation, <em>the pound sign.</em></p>

<p>I debated (I was the one who introduced the comment syntax first), and settled on <em>hashtag</em> because I was honestly not sure if the kids would know what "pound" meant in this scenario. It is "pound" to me, but I <em>thought</em> to hesitate -- it wasn't a realization that came from looks of confusion. <em>Hashtag</em> seemed like the most accessible to 12-year-olds (n.b. in a very privileged place).</p>

<p>I got teased about this. By my friend and fellow teacher, not by the kids. He asks, "When we say 'hashtag', is that how you'd refer to this symbol?" They nodded yes. He laughed, and I did too; he, and I, and these kids, aren't even separated by a "generation" (I don't believe in this as a static term, as several people have written about recently, but as a placeholder...). Although they are half my age or less for the most part, honestly.</p>

<p>And entertainingly, none of us thought of calling it the <em>number</em> sign.</p>

<p>I laughed about this again because when you type it as the title of a post in an Octopress <code>rake new_post</code> command, it's automatically converted to <code>the-number-sign</code>, as you can see in this post URL.</p>

<p>Vocabulary is interesting.</p>

<p>(Other things that are interesting: e-textiles, libraries as makerspaces, and the exciting trends in grade school education! and open badging! and the work being done around me all the time!)</p>

<p>Teaching kids how they can make stuff they want to make is <em>great.</em></p>

<li><p>Sometimes, the best system is Windows XP and Word 2000 and the mail app you hate.</p></li>
<li><p>The hardest part of unpaid tech support is learning when not to argue about (1).</p></li>
<li><p>"Being unpaid tech support" == being the youngest person in a group by 20+ years, having the most technical experience in a group re: profession or degree, or whichever turns out to be most applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>"whichever turns out to be the most applicable" in (3) is chiefly determined by your confidence in tone, if there is any question as to who's landed the job.</p></li>
<li><p>"Why" is the easiest question to ask and the hardest one to answer.*</p></li>
<li><p>I do not like the Mac OS X mail app.</p></li>
<li><p>Even beginning to describe the differences between what you work on and what their problem is tends to be worth it approximately 15% of the time. **</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that email (and all of the cloud) is (<em>theoretically</em>) unconstrained by political boundaries is a real conceptual jump from "snail mail." Especially if one's professional life has been largely spent, for example, writing books on yellow notepads.</p></li>
<li><p>"I can solve this problem I've never seen before", outside of work or a personal project, is often worth the frustration.***</p></li>
<li><p>You're probably familiar with <a href="http://xkcd.com/627/">the quintessential flow chart</a> (credit Randall Monroe under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">BY-NC</a> license), but there are people for whom the system this chart depends on makes sense, and there are people to whom it's another universe. The boundary is fluid -- I firmly believe this -- but if you're the resident expert (or whatever), it sure doesn't feel that way.</p></li>

<p>*I have further thoughts about this, but they're neither publicly available nor all written down</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><font size="-4">
I've worked in desktop support -- a little over two years ago now, on a hospital IT staff. I've also had interactions for a long time with others working in tech support roles/full-time jobs throughout most of my life. The post itself was prompted by a vacation on which I was the youngest by 45 years: let's guess what happened, eh? I think it was destined to be at that point, whether or not I'd actually let on that I work with computers.</p>

<p>A lot of years ago, young me, and my even younger brother, accidentally changed the resolution on the computer once and, after some struggles to return the icons to their usual, unpixelated sizes, I sent a good friend of our dad's, a computer consultant, a detailed email about what had happened and what we'd tried, asking how to fix it. He was grateful for the detail ("you wouldn't believe how many people don't..."), and I was grateful in return. I don't have the email anymore, but I remember it. And the worry over tales in the hospital IT office of doctors known to have a roar specially bottled for the tech support was assuaged by the look on the face of the nurse to whom I explained the use of a laptop trackpad.</p>

<p>This is to say, oh hey sarcasm font? (it keeps me alive! :D :D) -- and I really admire for the patient people who work(ed) full- or part-time in tech support longer than I have done so far. It's a really important job in a million circumstances, and it leads to pretty interesting revelations. (This vacation? I swear I didn't scream, just almost. But I learnt a lot.) I obviously have only my fraction of the experiences, yes. As usual, I welcome criticism and respect trying to learn new things. As with all lists of wide and silly generalizations, exceptions exist by the thousand, I know. [I've spent a lot (a LOT) of time on the internet.]
