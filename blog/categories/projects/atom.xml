    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quick drive-by: <a href="https://github.com/aerenchyma/instabitly">instabitly</a>, a script I wrote recently to import saved links from <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> to <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>.</p>

<p>I did it for personal reasons -- primarily because I want all this stuff stored redundantly. Obviously I haven't solved that problem in its entirety, but there were also other reasons. Because I care about things like this. There's a README. More, like more in the other documentation series I've discussed so far, will have to appear after recent projects calm down some.</p>
