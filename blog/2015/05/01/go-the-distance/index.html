<div class="entry-content"><p>Years ago, I wrote <a href="http://jczetta.net/blog/2012/05/02/highlight-of-the-job/">this</a>.</p>

<p>I moved away, thinking I&#8217;d spent my last autumn as a student in Michigan, and wished those who came after me the best. I wrote in that thing that I wished I could do it again, but I was moving away, hoping there&#8217;d be something similar somewhere else. I was so sorry that I couldn&#8217;t see the repeat, though.</p>

<p>The work I did for the next couple years was informed over and over again by what I did and how I felt that semester, newly graduated, teaching people things. What I didn&#8217;t realize 100% at the time was that the necessity of being a voice of authority, and even more, a voice of calm when learning frustrating things, taught me &#8211; yeah, yeah &#8211; how to be the teacher and the person I wanted to be. Remember when you sat down and built that app for them? You can do it again. I can think of few things as helpful and as useful.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A year and a half ago, again a student in Michigan (that&#8217;s another story) I saw a posting for a GSI (Graduate Student Instructor) position, the same professor as the professor for that class I refer to above. SI 106: Introductory Programming, economics of open source.</p>

<p>He hired me.</p>

<p>This week I wrapped up what for now is my last semester of three in a row teaching. With this week comes the end of my graduate school career (for now, probably forever), and also, undoubtedly, the end of one of the <em>best</em> jobs. I have been delighted to be a part of this in every way.</p>

<p>In 2012 I waxed nostalgic quickly, sappy as anything, wondering if my career path had been changed &#8211; yeah, it had been. I guess I probably knew that then.</p>

<p>The three semesters of Graduate Student Instruction (GSI is what U-M calls graduate student TAs, essentially) that that IA job basically led to have been some of the best of my life to this point. The job teaching students new to, and long familiar with, college has taught me so much about leadership and mentorship, team building and explanations and pedagogy. About people. About frustration and programming and Python and operatingn systems and the Internet, about systematic thinking and management and procrastination and friendship and creativity and writing. But seriously; all of the above. This has been a light every day, an anchor, a reminder about pretty much all the things, even the non-obvious things, that I love about my life. Pretty much the best job I can imagine for the time, even if not forever. (I&#8217;m not that into &#8220;forever.&#8221;) It has been immensely frustrating and tiring and stressful, and worth every moment of twelve-hour grading sessions and mornings that felt much too early and falling asleep on windowsills. Worth it, for every smile on someone&#8217;s face when they understand something new, every acknowledging nod, every brave question as students come to my office hours and raise their hands in my section and tell me, and people around them, that there&#8217;s something they don&#8217;t know, but they want to know, and everything I&#8217;ve learned about and laughed about with the people working alongside me, who have been reliably incredible.</p>

<p>That never gets less amazing. I&#8217;ve in some capacity or other been a teacher for, now, almost 300 students and I remember most of them (maybe all? The uncertainty is because I haven&#8217;t gone through to prove it and I&#8217;m not sure I have the access to), and every one of them has taught me something, probably, even the people I barely met in person (in someone else&#8217;s section, non-attending engineers taking an easy class&#8230;). It sounds exaggerated, ridiculous, but I&#8217;m not really sure that it is. There are so many flavors of worry and bravery, so many different flashes of younger versions of me I see in other people and attitudes toward a class, or the world, that I&#8217;m not sure I understand. Every week I have to remember, and am thrilled to remember: I probably don&#8217;t know your life, or what it&#8217;s like, and it is not my job to make those judgments. It is my job to convey information and try to make it accessible and clear. It is my job to be your advocate in this space, and that is enough to quell frustration and most exhaustion both.</p>

<p>It is so much to be the person things are told to. I remember professors&#8217; and GSIs&#8217; reactions to end-of-semester panic and assignment-turn-ins more than many things that blurred together in my four years of college as a student, and to be the source of that is incredible to me. I see people do this irresponsibly. I promise, and am proud to be able to promise, that I will do my best to never do that, even if I am not a student in a formal school environment anymore. I will not make fun of you such that it&#8217;s mean. You are forced to trust us teachers with things &#8211; that&#8217;s a big deal, and I respect that, so much. And on this side of the metaphorical curtain, to have gotten to share all this with other people sharing this role, or set of roles, with me, and talk about it to make us all better at it &#8211; holy crap, basically.</p>

<p>I sat down in office hours this past semester and told the story of coming home from my first programming class mid-semester, feeling entirely useless. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this, I think,&#8221; they tell me. I said, you know what? I&#8217;m getting hired as a software engineer. And I came from that. I see you. You can do this, too, if you want to, and we are here to help. It was true. I was right. I love being right! (Sometimes.)</p>

<p>I walk down the halls of my department building. Everyone in that class I wrote about in 2012 who was not a freshman at the time, or who was graduating early, is already done with college. One of those kids is a classmate of my fellow GSI in Winter 2014; she&#8217;ll graduate from grad school this week just like me (with less time off between, presumably), and I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s not the only one. One of the freshmen, to whom I obliquely referred in that post three years ago, stops me in the hall more than once. &#8220;Hey, Jackie! How&#8217;s it going?&#8221; A year ago, he tells me he&#8217;s building rails apps. Now he&#8217;s selling his stuff so he can leave town. I clap very loudly for him at graduation.</p>

<p>I got to work with former students. They teach me more about how to look at the world and new ways of thinking about grade organization and understanding concepts and music and just being a person.</p>

<p>This job and what I love about it led me to my next one.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like <a href="http://xkcd.com/353/">flying</a>. The Python helps, for sure, but it&#8217;s not everything.</p>

<p>I am so proud of being part of communities which try to be iteratively better. Consistently more welcoming. The <a href="http://recurse.com/about">Recurse Center</a> is one. <a href="http://commoncycle.org/">Common Cycle</a> is another, a place where it&#8217;s become clear I am one instigator of change but so far from the only one, a place where I am listened to without shouting (more on this another time, probably elsewhere), a place that helps people in ways I care about. A place that is about learning and teaching as totally integrated processes. I am so proud of that. This class has been another, and I look forward to all of them I&#8217;m already part of and will keep stepping into in the future. What can we do better? What do we know? Would this be interesting? Who does this serve? Why, why, why, and also how? This stuff is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aqpF-MwyUs">always sappy</a>, I know, but I have to say I don&#8217;t care &#8211; at least, I don&#8217;t mind. There aren&#8217;t a lot of things I am willing to speak publically about like this, but this matters too much.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; I said. I was wrong about not getting to iterate on my experience. I got to see! How cool is that!</p>
