  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://bit.ly/18Akcfu">Writes Bonnie Bogle of MapBox</a>,  &#8220;The diversity of our team has made our team stronger, our tools better, and our approaches smarter and more innovative.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aim I see here is really great. This is what I&#8217;d like to see more of.</p>

<p>When industries, platforms, and organizations I care about acknowledge not just that they care about diversity, but that they can explain why they care and what they want to do, that they&#8217;re serious for real reasons, I am pretty likely to talk about them positively, and excitedly, and often, to want to and try to use their products or services. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad to see this for many reasons, obviously. But maps affect nearly everyone in some way or another. Maps have effects on everyone and how people deal with others. How they travel. What they think of places they frequent and places they&#8217;ve never been. I don&#8217;t know this for sure, but I know it for me, and I see evidence of it everywhere. Maps help people form opinions on and gain knowledge about the public transit systems available (and unavailable!) to them. From maps arise issues of accessibility on multiple axes, a lot of frustration, metric tons of joy. (I love maps.) They help and hurt, but mostly, and certainly ideally, I believe they can and should and do help, and I think the world is moving closer, closer, to wholly positive maps all the time.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s always a long way to go but maps help me figure that out.</p>

<p>So for now, yeah: this made me happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past Friday, I joined forces with a friend for a fun remote lighting project using a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Remote lighting? you say. You know the colored stage lights you see in theatres? If you ever did tech for a production in high school in a small theatre without super-intense equipment, those are the ones we used. They were hooked up via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX_(lighting">DMX</a> ). (See <a href="http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA_Python_API">here</a> for more information about the Python API, which we used.)</p>

<p>Some of these lights were hooked up to a Pi, and the idea was that we would be able to pass a color (e.g. on a color wheel like you might see in Photoshop), and brightness, via a web interface, which would then set the lights on as specified.</p>

<p>Below is the how and the what, and the code. All you need to make this happen is the appropriate lights and wiring (I didn&#8217;t do this part, so I can&#8217;t speak to it), a Raspberry Pi, set up with wireless, and a computer with monitor and keyboard input/a laptop that can also access the wireless network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I went back to my old high school to help a friend teach middle schoolers an introductory workshop on Python and Raspberry Pi. It was thoroughly awesome, but amidst the awesome &#8211; which I&#8217;m not going to talk about in detail yet &#8211; I noticed something interesting:</p>

<p>Discussing comments in Python, someone in the room who graduated college several years before I did called &#8216;#&#8217;, without hesitation, <em>the pound sign.</em></p>

<p>I debated (I was the one who introduced the comment syntax first), and settled on <em>hashtag</em> because I was honestly not sure if the kids would know what &#8220;pound&#8221; meant in this scenario. It is &#8220;pound&#8221; to me, but I <em>thought</em> to hesitate &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t a realization that came from looks of confusion. <em>Hashtag</em> seemed like the most accessible to 12-year-olds (n.b. in a very privileged place).</p>

<p>I got teased about this. By my friend and fellow teacher, not by the kids. He asks, &#8220;When we say &#8216;hashtag&#8217;, is that how you&#8217;d refer to this symbol?&#8221; They nodded yes. He laughed, and I did too; he, and I, and these kids, aren&#8217;t even separated by a &#8220;generation&#8221; (I don&#8217;t believe in this as a static term, as several people have written about recently, but as a placeholder&#8230;). Although they are half my age or less for the most part, honestly.</p>

<p>And entertainingly, none of us thought of calling it the <em>number</em> sign.</p>

<p>I laughed about this again because when you type it as the title of a post in an Octopress <code>rake new_post</code> command, it&#8217;s automatically converted to <code>the-number-sign</code>, as you can see in this post URL.</p>

<p>Vocabulary is interesting.</p>

<p>(Other things that are interesting: e-textiles, libraries as makerspaces, and the exciting trends in grade school education! and open badging! and the work being done around me all the time!)</p>

<p>Teaching kids how they can make stuff they want to make is <em>great.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick drive-by: <a href="https://github.com/aerenchyma/instabitly">instabitly</a>, a script I wrote recently to import saved links from <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> to <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>.</p>

<p>I did it for personal reasons &#8211; primarily because I want all this stuff stored redundantly. Obviously I haven&#8217;t solved that problem in its entirety, but there were also other reasons. Because I care about things like this. There&#8217;s a README. More, like more in the other documentation series I&#8217;ve discussed so far, will have to appear after recent projects calm down some.</p>

<p>Let me also take this opportunity to encourage you to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/subscription">support Instapaper</a> if you can and it&#8217;s a service you like/use.</p>

<p>In my imaginary free time, I have been trying to absorb all the <a href="http://pyvideo.org/category/33/pycon-us-2013">fantastic PyCon</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides">talks</a> (I have an active imagination).</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last May, when I was first thinking about applying to <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>, I did a lot of searching for posts and tweets about it. I wanted to know what the experience was like, the day-to-day, the people. I found some, and <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/about" target="_blank">the website does give a very accurate picture</a> of <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/testimonials" target="_blank">the environment</a> around all the time at Hacker School, but I wished for more because I&#8217;m curious, especially about the environment alongside the programming. Hacker School is all about being a better programmer &#8211; going after that goal has come with a lot of side pluses.</p>

<p>(There&#8217;s now <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7kld/iama_hacker_at_hacker_school_in_nyc_ama/">an IAmA for Hacker School going on @ Reddit</a>, where a bunch of current Hackerschoolers and alums are articulately answering questions. So you should go there.)</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;d say that if you have a real inclination to apply &#8211; if you think you might love programming &#8211; if the sound of Hacker School interests you &#8211; do it. Do it soon, do it now! <a href="http://www.hackerschool.com/apply">Just click here</a>! I understand that moving to NYC on somewhat quick notice is intimidating, that you&#8217;re not sure what will happen with work or other potential commitments, that maybe the cost is concerning, but I swear the facilitators and even your fellow batch-mates (especially if there are people coming back who are familiar with the process!) are incredibly helpful with that stuff, in particular with finding housing. It&#8217;s workable, not so bad, even without much stress!, and having the option is worth the application time.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a woman who needs financial assistance, I can&#8217;t emphasize enough, <i>don&#8217;t</i> hesitate because you&#8217;re afraid it won&#8217;t work out! This batch, every accepted woman who requested a grant received one, and there&#8217;s no reason to believe that won&#8217;t happen again.</p>

<p>Secondly, here&#8217;s another addition to the growing library of &#8216;what it&#8217;s like at Hacker School&#8217;. As we approach the end of batch[3] &#8211; (numbers started at 0, of course), I&#8217;m just gonna list you some things I did this summer, in no particular order.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Spent a wholly worthwhile thirteen total out of about forty hours in Central Park one Thursday - Friday. Most of those were waiting in line for tickets to As You Like It in the Park. Many of those hours were talking and laughing with a Hacker School friend. Some were making an attempt at a picnic at sunrise. Some of them were us programming in Python in a text editor and REPL with an Android phone. (Three of the hours were at night, watching the show, which was one of the best Shakespeare performances I&#8217;ve ever seen.)</p></li>
<li><p>Played in a Hacker School Ping Pong tournament. (No requirement to be especially good. Hence &lt;&#8211; .) The first Ping Pong tournament, a laptop was pulled out midway through&#8230; now, there is a relative-player-ranking system that a fellow Hackerschooler implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost made it to building and launching homemade water rockets.</p></li>
<li><p>Went on an 11-person, 120-total-dumpling tour in Chinatown. Wandered for hours below 14th street talking about fascinating things incl. translations of brand names and living in different areas of the country. (&#8230;not on the same day.)</p></li>
<li><p>Got delicious Malaysian food, tasted the best guacamole of my life, ventured to Long Island for a cupcake baked by an awesome fellow Hackerschooler (worth the trip!). I&#039;ve eaten crazy delicious stuff while in New York [and most of it wasn&#8217;t too expensive + in good company].</p></li>
<li><p>Had many dinners and lunches and otherwise hanging out with alums, current batch members, Hacker School facilitators wherein there were discussions of topics ranging from the structure of Git, to islands in the Pacific where time is measured differently, to what is nerve-wracking about interviews, to the best kind of chocolate (no consensus), to what we were like as teenagers in various capacity, to awesome books recently read, to the differences between ricotta, queso fresco and paneer.</p></li>
<li><p>Collapsed laughing over the packaging of bear-shaped cookies sold at a nearby cafe during a quick programming break. Began to learn Cued Speech. Ran outside to dance around in a sudden rainstorm by the Brooklyn Bridge.</p></li>
<li><p>Got basically addicted to iced coffee: people at a nearby cafe* have started recognizing some of our orders; we joke about it, slash about how many times we&#8217;ve been there. <s>Each day.</s> I&#8217;ve been there a&#8230;lot. (Coffee ice cubes in the iced coffee/espresso drinks. Need I say more.)</p></li>
<li><p>Learned tons about parsing, web scraping, Ruby, dealing with dynamic web content, tree- and graph-traversal algorithms, multiple web frameworks, client-side Javascript debugging, how to structure my time, how to read a large code base better, short presentations, window managers, various contributions to open source projects, awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>s, how to use Git well (and <a href="http://marthakelly.github.com/blog/2012/06/04/hacker-school-day-one/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t worry at all</a> if you don&#8217;t know about any one or any of those things). Also, about baking, varieties of international visas, mapping, moving, chemicals, New York, regions of the US, circuits, public speaking, work environments, acidic agents in cheese-making and tons of other things; that&#8217;s not a comprehensive list. I&#8217;m going back to school (for grad school in CS) in the fall (this was already a plan when I applied to Hacker School), but I now feel solidly on a trajectory to doing whatever the hell I want, and learning whatever that requires, in a way I did not at the beginning of June. (I&#8217;ve also gained an even more thorough respect for transportation networks, something I already loved a lot.) Seeing pairs of people attempt things totally new to them and be ridiculous successful while you and others do the same at the next table is the best.</p></li>
<li><p>Met some of the most impressive and inspiring thinkers, programmers, cooks, writers, feminists, and <i>people</i> I&#8217;ve ever met at once. I&#8217;ve made really good friends with whom I&#8217;ve done lots of entirely random and excellent things, who have changed how I think about things spanning-realms-within and far-beyond programming, and I&#8217;m not planning to disappear &#8211; I&#8217;ll be back to visit.</p></li>
<li><p>More than a year later, I come back to this post, and while I have plenty to add, the most important cultural thing I can say about Hacker School now is that not only do I continue to realize things I gained in the summer of 2012, programming and other-wise, but on numerous trips around the country (the US, in my case), it&#8217;s often Hacker Schoolers in all these cities that make them feel a little bit like home.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You should probably apply. If you read this you should apply. (If you didn&#8217;t, and you enjoy programming, you should also apply, but that&#8217;s probably not relevant at this juncture.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On May first, I reached the end of Michigan&#8217;s 2012 Winter semester, and with it the end of one of the best jobs. A student called the deadline for the final projects the &#8220;end of an era&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s what it felt like to us (the staff), too. (&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re doing twenty projects!&#8221;)</p>

<p>Except that it&#8217;s more thrilling to watch people work together and seriously, rapidly and usefully learn stuff, and help each other &#8211; better to watch forty-some eureka moments than only have a few yourself.</p>
