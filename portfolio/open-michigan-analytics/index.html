  <p>This project was initiated in late January/early February 2013, with the idea that many content creators who publish openly licensed work on <a href="http://open.umich.edu">Open.Michigan</a> would send questions to our team: <em>how many people have viewed and downloaded the stuff I made?</em> The project has evolved in the months since then, with separate goals for multiple phases.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve led the project, with Kathleen Omollo, Pieter Kleymeer, Kevin Coffman, and Dave Malicke, with input from many other members of the <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/enablingtech/home">Office of Enabling Technologies</a> in the <a href="http://medicine.umich.edu/dept/msis/about-msis/learning-program">MSIS Learning Program</a>.</p>

<p>The original spark of the project came from Open.Michigan&#8217;s content creators, so we decided to focus on them; you can read more about the initiation of the project and its first phase <a href="https://open.umich.edu/blog/2013/05/22/opening-up-our-web-analytics-for-dynamic-public-display/">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, we wanted to figure out where the impetus for sharing our usage information was really coming from. Could we find some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics">analytics</a> on our content? was our first question, but in trying to answer that, I realized that we needed to answer a different question: <em>who wants our usage data/information, and why?</em> For whom are we creating this information access? Different people want different things for different reasons. I conducted seven interviews with content creators who have different roles at the University of Michigan and our partner organizations, and four interviews in-office, some of which consisted of discussion and some a card-sorting exercise, in order to determine <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/04/user-research-for-personas-and-other-audience-models.php">personas</a> and prioritize goals for the project.</p>

<p>Ensuing phases have included writing <a href="https://github.com/openmichigan/oerbit_analytics">a Drupal/OERbit module</a> which creates button to show view and download metrics for individual courses on <a href="https://open.umich.edu/wiki/OERbit">OERbit</a> (my first foray into Drupal), user research to plan redesign for that information sharing, a dynamic dashboard framework (code to be opened soon) for integration with OERbit that will display time series data across recent and extended time periods on individual courses and units within Open.Michigan, a tool to create PDFs of time series data and aggregate metrics for individual courses, units, and groups of material created by a certain person/organization, and a still-in-progress project to give programmers and data analysts interested in the open education space <a href="http://aerenchyma.github.io/portfolio/REST-API-with-Express/">a REST API</a> with which to access Open.Michigan data.</p>

<p>Future phases will include more formal sharing of the anonymous data gathered from user research, integration of other information and metadata, including the numbers of completed translations of videos that Open.Michigan and the <a href="http://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork">African Health OER Network</a> host, and real analytics &#8211; finding <em>truly meaningful patterns</em> in the data we collect &#8211; rather than only basic metrics for impact measurement. User research previously done will help me, and others on our team, identify what are genuinely &#8220;meaningful patterns.&#8221; Some of these may include comparisons of types of materials within units over time, which may help content creators make recommendations and better-informed decisions about creation of new open resources. Others might be comparisons to other similarly sized or similarly focused units within the University of Michigan or comparisons with other Open Educational Resource platforms, such that content creators can have a better understanding of the impact they create with open resources, and an easy way of providing evidence that their work in this space is noticed and used.</p>
